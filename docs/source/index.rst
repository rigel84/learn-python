This is a completely free, self-paced, open-source, online course on the Python programming language. It assumes no 
prior programming experience, and is appropriate for anyone who wants to learn Python. The course is broken up into
modules. Each module will introduce a series of concepts and then end with gateway programming assignments that will
develop your understanding of the concepts through practice. The main modules are designed to be completed in order.
The special topics have no required order but will only be useful after you have completed the main modules.

The course takes a tools-first approach to learning the language. By installing, downloading and testing the course
you will be using many of the tools that professional Python programmers use every day. The gateway assignments are
tested using tools used to test Python code in the industry. The documentation you are reading right now is part of
the course and you will be regenerating it as you work through the course to track your progress.


Getting help
------------

The course comes with an AI tutor called Delphi that will help you with the gateway assignments. The tutor is not
required but can be helpful. If you are taking this course as part of a directed class you will need to register
course with the |course server| - this will also activate the tutor. You may also self activate the 
tutor - read more here.
