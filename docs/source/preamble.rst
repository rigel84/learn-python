Preamble: What is a Computer?
=============================

This preamble is not required to understand the rest of the course. It provides some key
context that is helpful in building a mental model of what a computer is and how it works.
There are enumerable better and more detailed resources on this topic - this intro just
lightly scratches the surface of key concepts and terminology you might encounter when
learning Python. The keynote presentation covered in the video below can be downloaded
:download:`here <../../learn_python/preamble/PythonPreamble.key>`. The diagrams covered
in the video are also included below.
